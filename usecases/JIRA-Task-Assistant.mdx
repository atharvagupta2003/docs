# Jira Integration Tools Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Jira integration tools and classes, detailing their responsibilities, features, and workflows. This system allows the creation of Jira stories, test issues, and permission checks within Jira, as well as integrating with Xray for test management.

---

## Overview

The Jira integration tools facilitate various Jira operations such as creating stories, creating and linking Xray test issues, and checking user permissions. These tools utilize APIs provided by Jira and Xray, incorporating token management and secure credential handling through `AssistantConfig`.

## Classes and Components

### JiraTestCreation

- **Purpose**: Handles the creation of Xray test issues and manages Xray API interactions.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Token Management**: Authenticates with Xray to obtain an access token.
  - **Test Issue Creation**: Creates multiple Jira test issues with specified details and types.
  - **Job Status Tracking**: Checks the status of the test import job and retrieves the keys of the created test issues.

- **Methods**:
  - **get_xray_token**: Authenticates with Xray using the client ID and secret to retrieve an access token.
  - **create_jira_tests**: Creates Xray test issues based on provided test details (summary, description, type, and steps).
  - **get_job_status**: Tracks the status of a bulk test creation job until completion, returning the keys of successfully created test issues.

### CreateJiraStoryWithTestsTool

- **Purpose**: Creates a Jira story and links it to newly created Xray test issues.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Test Creation and Linking**: Uses `JiraTestCreation` to create test issues and link them to the Jira story.
  - **Story Creation**: Creates a Jira story using provided summary and description.
  - **Linking Test Issues**: Links created test issues to the Jira story.

- **Workflow**:
  1. **Initialization**: Retrieves configuration details and sets up API parameters.
  2. **Run Method (`_run`)**:
     - Calls `create_jira_tests` to create test issues and obtain their keys.
     - Creates a Jira story and retrieves its key.
     - Links each test issue to the Jira story by creating an issue link in Jira.
  3. **Return Value**: Returns a success message with the URL of the created Jira story.

### CreateJiraTicketTool

- **Purpose**: Creates a Jira ticket with a specified summary and description.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Configurable Issue Type**: Configures the issue type as "Task" for cloud instances or "Bug" otherwise.
  - **Secure Authentication**: Uses stored credentials for authentication.

- **Workflow**:
  1. **Initialization**: Retrieves configuration values such as Jira domain, project key, and credentials.
  2. **Run Method (`_run`)**:
     - Sends a POST request to create a new Jira issue with specified fields.
     - Returns the URL of the created ticket or an error message if creation fails.

### CheckUserPermissionTool

- **Purpose**: Checks if a user has permissions to create stories in a specified Jira project.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Permission Verification**: Checks if the specified user has permission to create issues in the Jira project.
  - **Authentication Flow**: Ensures that the user is authenticated via email verification before checking permissions.

- **Workflow**:
  1. **Initialization**: Loads project and user authentication details.
  2. **Run Method (`_run`)**:
     - Calls `is_user_assignable` to check if the user is assignable to the project.
     - Returns a message indicating whether the user has permission to create issues.
  3. **Helper Method (`is_user_assignable`)**: Searches for the user in the assignable users of the project to confirm permission.

## Class-Specific Details

### JiraTestCreation

- **get_xray_token**: Authenticates with Xray by sending the client ID and secret to retrieve an access token. Raises an exception if the token retrieval fails.

- **create_jira_tests**:
  - Parameters: Accepts a list of dictionaries for test details (summary, description, type, etc.).
  - Returns: A string containing the keys of the created test issues, separated by commas.
  - Workflow:
    1. Retrieves Xray token.
    2. Constructs payload based on test details.
    3. Sends a POST request to Xray’s bulk import API.
    4. Retrieves the job ID and checks the job status using `get_job_status`.

- **get_job_status**:
  - Parameters: Xray token and job ID.
  - Returns: The keys of successfully created test issues.
  - Workflow:
    - Periodically checks the job status until it’s complete.
    - If the job is successful, retrieves and returns test issue keys.
    - Raises exceptions for failed or unsuccessful job statuses.

### CreateJiraStoryWithTestsTool

- **Run Method (`_run`)**:
  - Parameters: Summary and description of the Jira story, list of test dictionaries.
  - Returns: URL of the created Jira story and linked test issues.
  - Workflow:
    1. Calls `JiraTestCreation.create_jira_tests` to create test issues.
    2. Creates the Jira story with specified summary and description.
    3. Links each created test issue to the Jira story.
    4. Returns a success message with the story URL.

### CreateJiraTicketTool

- **Run Method (`_run`)**:
  - Parameters: Summary and description of the Jira ticket.
  - Returns: URL of the created Jira ticket or an error message.
  - Workflow:
    1. Creates a Jira issue with provided details.
    2. Sets issue type to "Task" or "Bug" based on instance type.
    3. Returns URL of the created ticket or error details on failure.

### CheckUserPermissionTool

- **Run Method (`_run`)**:
  - Parameters: User’s email.
  - Returns: Message indicating if the user has permission to create issues in the Jira project.
  - Workflow:
    1. Calls `is_user_assignable` to verify user’s permissions.
    2. If assignable, returns confirmation; otherwise, returns a lack of permission message.
  - **is_user_assignable**:
    - Parameters: User email and project key.
    - Returns: Boolean indicating if the user is assignable in the project.

## Security and Authentication

Each class and tool in this documentation is designed with secure authentication mechanisms:

- **Credential Handling**: Uses `AssistantConfig` to securely retrieve API credentials.
- **Token Management**: Manages tokens for Xray and Jira APIs to ensure secure access.
- **Permission Checks**: Ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions, particularly with `CheckUserPermissionTool`.

---

## Conclusion

The Jira integration tools provide a structured and secure way to interact with Jira for creating stories, linking tests, and verifying permissions. The modular design and secure handling of authentication and tokens ensure compliance with best practices for system integration and operational security. For additional functionality, consider expanding the tools to support more detailed permission checks, issue linking options, or Xray test case management features.
